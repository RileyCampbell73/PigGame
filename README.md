Project for Component Class at Fanshawe College.

Made by Riley Campbell and James Haig!

Up to 6 players can play a game where each player takes turns rolling a die and try to get 100 points. To obtain points you roll the die on your turn and add up all the rolls. If they player rolls a 1, their turn is over and they lose all the points they have earned during their turn. The player may choose to end their turn and keep there points at any time.
